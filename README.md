# HACKSTER
An open-source song guessing game.
This repository includes code for 
* a webapp that allows people to create and print their own playing cards from public Spotify playlists,
as well as
* an app that allows users to scan these playing cards and play the encoded songs in the background.

The webapp should work out-of-the-box as it is just a simple HTML file.
The mobile app can be built for Android using Flutter (iOS support may or may not come in the future). There is also an APK file included in the "Releases" section. Full song playback requires a Spotify Premium account.
